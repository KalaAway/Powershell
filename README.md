This is a collection of Powershell code that I've written, modified, or copied for use on the job.  Some of the scripts provided here are simple one liners that I was playing around with and thought might be useful in the future.  Others are bits of code kludged together in to a semi-workable tool (i'm not a very eloquent coder).

Proper attribution is provided in the comments of each script.  If i've used your code, thank you very much for writing it.  If you've provided me with some help in getting past a mental block, then thank you - doubly so!
